## We develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow), so all code changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Git Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). 
If you need more [details](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch `feature` from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/alkevin/music-all-front/issues)
